# Spring_Bookcase

This a Spring Boot API reflecting my Bookcase being a chaning collection of different books. 
The application allows me to add a new book to my collection, update books' details, find a book sorted by Id Number and delete id I sell, donate or give my book away.

**The purpose of this project**

    I created this project is to put in the practice some knowledge and skills I gained during my 9-week Software Engeenering Bootcamp. 
    I find it very helpfull for revising, systematising and memorising learned topics. Additionally, in the future it might also be a good starting point to building my portfolio.

**How I expected the challenge to go**

    Before I started this challenge I was affraid I would be facing a lot of bugs and errors when writig my code, problems with utilising Git and Jira Board. 
    Suprisingly, I was more independent when creating my application then I predicted. I am overally proud of myself as this is the first application written by myself in my life.

**Obstacles and Succeses**

    I fund working on different branches in Git quite intimidating. During the course we were only using a main branch. 
    I could understand a concept of working on many branches, however putting it in practice when creating my final project ment possibility of facing unexpected problems including loosing the whole work or messing it up.

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project**

    Creating multiple tables for the application (for instance collection of artists and songs) with additional method/s allowing sorting my books aphabetically etc.
