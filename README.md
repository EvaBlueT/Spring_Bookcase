# Spring_Bookcase

1. Why am I doing this? 

    The purpose of creating this project is to put in the practice the knowledge I gained during my 9-week Software Engeenering Bootcamp. I find it very helpfull for revising, systematising and memorising learned topics. Additionally, in the future it might also be a starting point to building my portfolio.

2. How I expected the challenge to go?

    Before I started my challenge I was affraid I would be facing a lot of bugs and errors when writig my code. Despite I wish, I was more independent when creating my application I am overally proud of myself as this is the first application written by myself in my life.

3. What went well? / What did not go as planned? 

    I wish my application to be more creative. 

4. Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

    Creating multiple tables for the application with additional method/s allowing sorting my books aphabetically etc.

5. Screenshots showing my postman requests and the output from the API. 

    Please find screenshots in a separete folder called Screenshots.

6. Screenshots of my database to prove that data is being persisted.
