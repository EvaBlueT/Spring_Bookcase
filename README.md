# Spring_Bookcase

This is a Spring Boot API reflecting my Bookcase - digital collection of books. 
The application allows me to add books to my collection, update books' details, find a book by Id Number and delete it in case I do not owe it anymore.

**The purpose of this project**

I created this project to put into practice some knowledge and skills I gained during my 9-week Software Engineering Bootcamp. 
I find it very helpful for revising, systematising and memorising learned topics. Additionally, in the future it might also be a good starting point to building my portfolio.

**How I expected the challenge to go**

Before I started this challenge I was afraid I would be facing a lot of errors when writing my code, problems with utilising Git and Jira Board. 
Surprisingly, I was more independent when creating my application than I predicted. Overall, I am proud of myself as this is the first application written by myself in my life.

**Obstacles and Successes**

Working on different branches has been a little bit challenging for me. 
I could understand a general concept of working on many branches, however putting it in practice when creating my final project ment possibility of facing unexpected problems including losing some work or written code to collapse. I used it as an opportunity to learn more about git branching and finally was successful with using it. 

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project**

Creating multiple tables for the application (for instance collection of artists and songs) with additional method/s allowing sorting my books alphabetically etc.
